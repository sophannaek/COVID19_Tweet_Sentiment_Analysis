## Current Work -- Streaming Tweet Sentiment Analysis and Spam Detection
The research focused on Tweet batch processing sentimental analysis and spam dectection on covid-19 related tweets in three categories: economy, politics and vaccine related. I've always had a hugh interest on Big Data and streaming processing, but I couldn't be able to work on the streaming processing due to the limited time and resources during the semester. Therefore, I've decided to continue this research on my own.
